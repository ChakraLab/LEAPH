In situ functional cell phenotyping reveals microdomain networks

# Summary
The functional response of a cell is determined not only by its internal state, but also by its interactions with its neighbors, and the stimulus it receives from its local environment (‘microdomain’). Predefined cell types based on dichotomous cell states fail to capture the highly plastic functional phenotypic continuum of cells in a complex setting such as the tumor microenvironment (Vitali et al, 2021). To address this challenge, we present **LEAPH**, an unsupervised machine **le**arning **a**lgorithm for identifying functional cell **ph**enotypes (Furman et al, 2021). 

The LEAPH approach is unbiased and automated, using spatial analytics with recursive steps of probabilistic clustering and spatial regularization
to characterize functional phenotypes (FPs) on a continuum from hyperplexed datasets. The traditional approaches to cell phenotyping focus on each cell type alone, while functional cell phenotyping presented here focuses on interactions among different cell phenotypes and associates these cell phenotype interactions with clinical outcomes. Functional cell phenotyping infers particular functional outcomes generating testable hypotheses thus moving well beyond simple cell phenotyping and distinguishable from typical cell phenotyping.
LEAPH further enables discovery of microdomains and signaling networks associated with and potentially driving disease progression and outcome.
